                    <p>
                        <img src="img/merilee.jpg" alt="">

                        Sometimes great things come from humble beginnings. For Merilee Wilbur, that beginning came
                        in
                        the form of a request from her 8-year-old son, Jake, who needed a snack to take to his chess
                        club meeting. Merilee flipped through her recipe box and pulled out her grandmother's recipe
                        for
                        Chess Pie. Perfect!
                    </p>

                    <p>The pie was such a hit with the kids - and their coach - that Merilee started getting
                        requests to bake pies for other occasions: school events, birthdays, even a Pi Day
                        celebration at the local library. Pie in the Sky Bakery was born.

                    </p>
                    pShe got so many orders that her fledgling business soon outgrew her family's kitchen. In 2006,
                    she rented her current location at 34 Main Street, where she and her team of bakers have served
                    up fresh, delicious pies ever since.

                            Merilee sure knows how to bake! Not a week goes by that I don't stop in for a slice of her
                            cherry pie. They truly are just like Mother used to make.
